# EEG-Based-Study-of-Altered-Behaviour-in-Psychopath

We trained a model which will predict Healthy controls, non-psychopathic offenders and psychopathic offenders by analyzing the existing dataset.

### Dataset : This project will utilize a dataset distributed by : https://doi.org/10.34973/qqr5-9s48

In This dataset two experimental tasks were employed using individualized rewards and their subjective values to study (1) passive avoidance and reversal learning (PasRev dataset) and (2) risky decision making (WoF dataset) in offenders with and without psychopathy, as well as healthy controls. The results showed that sufficient subjective value of reward facilitates acquisition but not response reversal in psychopathic offenders.

They did find psychopathic offenders to be guided more by pay-off sizes than probabilities. They did not find any effects of subjective reward value on overall risky decision making. These findings suggest that specific reinforcement learning impairments often found in individuals with psychopathy can be reduced with the use of personalized rewards.
